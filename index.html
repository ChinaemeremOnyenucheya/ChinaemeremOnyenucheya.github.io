In order to assess my competence in HTML5,CSS and Bootstrap, I tried recreating the webpage of a vocational and technical skills acquisition academy called “traindemy”(www.traindemy.com). In my work, I used “cards” instead of the “image-text overlay” as seen on the academy’s webpage. The pictures I used were randomly extracted from the internet. It is also worthy to note that the academy’s webpage is dynamic (some of the features I saw during the time I recreated it have been repositioned /changed).
